# Email address validation
To test the email validation program in batch mode with test data files, I followed a structured process.
Initially, I gathered various test data files containing email addresses, both valid and invalid, based on the defined rules for email validation. 
Each test file covered different scenarios and edge cases specified in the validation rules. 
The program was designed to read these test files, extract the email addresses, and run them through the machine learning-based email validation algorithm.
Upon execution, the program iterated through each test file, extracted the email addresses, and subjected them to the validation algorithm.
For each email address encountered, the algorithm performed feature extraction based on length, presence of '@' symbol, and potentially more complex features inferred from the rules. 
The algorithm then used the trained classifier to predict the validity of each email address.
The success of the email validation algorithm was assessed based on its ability to correctly categorize each email address in the test files as valid or invalid according to the predefined rules. 
The algorithm's success was evaluated by comparing its predictions with the ground truth labels in the test data. 
A high accuracy rate in correctly identifying valid and invalid emails would indicate a successful validation process, whereas a lower accuracy rate might imply areas for improvement in the algorithm or the need for additional features or model enhancements to handle complex cases more accurately. 
Adjustments to the model, incorporating more diverse features, or augmenting the training data could potentially enhance the algorithm's performance in handling various email validation scenarios.
